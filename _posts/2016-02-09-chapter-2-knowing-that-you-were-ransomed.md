**_Conduct yourselves with
fear throughout the time of your exile, knowing that you were ransomed... ~1
Peter 1:17-18_**

The
greatest realities in the universe are wrapped up in the paradox of God's wrath
and love. Reading through the Old Testament, you can almost feel the urgent leaning
forward, pressing in farther and farther to the paradox, looking for the answer
but never quite arriving. The prophet Habakkuk complains about the mingling of
divine justice and mercy, until he throws up his hands in worshipful surrender,
saying, "Yet I will rejoice in Yahweh; I will take joy in the God of my
salvation" (Habakkuk 3:18). Afflicted and beaten down, Job longed for a
mediator between a holy God and sinful man who could reconcile the realities of
divine punishment and divine clemency. But when God finally addresses him, Job's
trembling response was humbled repentance: "I have uttered what I did not
understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know... therefore I
despise myself and repent in dust and ashes" (Job 42:3,6). The Psalms tremble
with brokenness and beauty, an agonized wrestling with a just and loving God: "I
say to God, my rock, 'Why have you forgotten me?... Why are you cast down, O my
soul, and why are you in turmoil within me? Hope in God; for I shall again
praise him, my salvation and my God'" (Psalm 42:9,11). The last prophet of the
Old Testament, Malachi, gives the final word on fearing God, a simultaneous
promise of hope and horror: "The day is coming, burning like an oven, when all
the arrogant and all evildoers will be stubble. The day that is coming shall
set them ablaze, says the LORD of hosts, so that it will leave them neither
root nor branch. But for you who fear my name, the sun of righteousness shall
rise with healing in its wings" (Malachi 4:1-2). In fact, the last sentence of
the Old Testament is a promise of the coming messiah and the restoration of
God's people. But the last word in that sentence, the final word of the Old
Testament? "Destruction." And so the curtain falls on the Old Testament with the
paradox unresolved.

GOOD NEWS
OR OLD NEWS?

With the
fullness of the new covenant and the resolution of the paradox in Jesus' death
and resurrection at last unveiled, the apostle Peter stands amazed, and invites
us to participate in his amazement. Trace carefully what Peter says about the
resolution of the paradox:

__

_Concerning this
salvation, the prophets who prophesied about the grace that was to be yours
searched and inquired carefully, inquiring what person or time the Spirit of
Christ in them was indicating when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and
the subsequent glories. It was revealed to them that they were serving not
themselves but you, in the things that have been announced to you through those
who preached the good news to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, things
into which angels long to look. ~1 Peter 1:10-12_

All those
prophets---Habakkuk, Job, David, Malachi, and others---saw the grace that has now
been given to you, and longed to experience and understand what you enjoy. You
enjoy access into the mind and heart of God unparalleled in all of redemptive
history, because you are the recipient of the unveiling of the greatest
realities in the universe. The "sufferings of Christ and the subsequent
glories" are the answer to every unanswered question of the Old Testament. All
of those prophecies, Peter said, were ultimately not for their benefit, but for
yours, that you might more fully know and rejoice in the paradox of God. They
saw the shadows dimly from a distance; you get to sit back and enjoy the
substance.

But it
gets even better than that. Did you see the last phrase of Peter's? All this
glory, all this grace, all this good news, are "things into which angels long
to look." All the angelic hosts of heaven are utterly baffled by this mystery.
They themselves stand in awe of the God of wrath and love, and even though they
have heavenly, front-row seats to the paradox, they long to understand and
experience what you enjoy.

That's a
truly tremendous thing to say; I can't think of a bigger way to state the
massive significance of Jesus' death and resurrection than to say, "Even angels
long to look into these things." 

The
intermingling of judgment and mercy, the sacrificial death of God's Son, and
the everlasting rescue of rebels, are utterly baffling to the heavenly host. 

But it
does beg a question: to what extent are you enjoying the grace that prophets searched
for and angels long to understand? Are you amazed by the grace that you have
received, or have the most breathtaking realities in the universe become
routine to you? Has the good news become old news?

If it
has, don't despair. Peter continues, laying a foundation for a life motivated
by amazing grace, captivated by the fear of God at the foot of the cross. Read
on:

__

_Therefore, preparing
your minds for action, and being sober-minded, set your hope fully on the grace
that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. As obedient
children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance, but as
he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, since it is
written, "You shall be holy, for I am holy." And if you call on him
as Father who judges impartially according to each one's deeds, conduct
yourselves with fear throughout the time of your exile, knowing that you were
ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your forefathers, not with
perishable things such as silver or gold, but with the precious blood of
Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot. ~1 Peter 1:13-19_

I love
the phrase, "Set your hope 

_fully_

on
the grace that will be brought to you." Believer, anchor your security in one
thing and one thing only: the amazing grace that saved a wretch like you. The
unveiled paradox of wrath and love is the foundation of all hope and
confidence. Don't trust your works, your faith, your repentance, or any other
host of good things; Jesus, and Jesus alone, is the only source of salvation
and security.

And yet,
if you truly understand that, if you are amazed by the grace that amazes
angels, if your hope is fully set on free grace, the result will not be a lazy
life of wishy-washy commitment. No, your life will look like "obedient
children." Amazing grace is transforming grace. Grace that does not amaze will
not transform, and if you're not being transformed by it, it's because you're
not amazed. Amazement lies at the heart of all Christian transformation. The
paradox at the blazing heart of God, when it captures 

_your_

heart, will start to work its way out in your life by making
you look more and more like the paradox you love. "As he who called you is
holy"---that is, utterly unique, set apart, and radically committed to justice
and mercy---"you also be holy in all your conduct, since it is written, 'You
shall be holy, for I am holy.'" Let your life be like a lens refracting the
beauty of the paradox into this darkened world, so that people can see the holy
love of God worked out through your own love of sinful people.

As we
keep reading, we see how Peter makes clear that the life he is describing is no
less than what it means to fear God. "If you call on him as Father who
judges impartially according to each one's deeds, conduct yourselves with fear
throughout the time of your exile." The reality that our heavenly Father
is a holy and impartial judge, Peter said, should fill us with an appropriate
holy fear of displeasing him. He is a gracious, lavish, blessing, pursuing
Father... but he is also a holy, wrathful, sin-hating Father. These twin
realities are the paradox that has saved us, and we must never lose sight of
both sides of our Father's heart. If we lose sight of his kindness, we will
only view him with a slavish fear-- and that's not the kind of fear Peter is
talking about here. But conversely, if we lose sight of his ferocious holiness,
we will forget that our Father has high standards for his children and will
miss the whole meaning of the Lord's prayer: "Our Father in heaven,
hallowed be your name." That means, let your name be seen as holy, held in
reverence... starting with me and everyone who sees me.

KNOWING
YOU WERE RANSOMED

Those two
aspects of the paradox-- our Father's holiness and his great love for us-- are always
in tension in the Christian life as we fight for clearer views of his grace and
continue to struggle with indwelling sin. That's why Peter says that we are to
conduct ourselves with fear in a certain, specific kind of way. He says to
conduct yourselves with fear... knowing something. "Conduct yourselves
with fear throughout the time of your exile, 

_knowing that you were ransomed_

." 

This
sentence is the clearest place in the Bible where the fear of God and the grace
of God are brought together. In fact, it was this sentence that prompted me to
write this whole book. "Conduct yourself with fear, knowing that you were
ransomed." This is, in the words of John Newton, "grace that taught my heart to
fear." In the ransom that God paid for us at the cross, we see the paradox of God's
holiness and love brought together. Any kind of fear that lacks this knowledge
of redemption will ultimately prove destructive. But fear of God that says,
"Father, you are holy... and you have redeemed me," is the kind of
fear that Proverbs 14:27 talks about: "The fear of Yahweh is a fountain of
life." This is the kind of fear that the paradox of God creates, on which
the entire Christian life is based. This is not slavish fear of punishment;
this is the fear of a child who knows his father's love and delight and
therefore eagerly wants to please him. Only a knowledge of gospel redemption
can create this kind of fear in our hearts.

So how
exactly does this work? How does the gospel operate to create this kind of fear
in our hearts and in our lives? The gospel fear that we need to cultivate, the
kind of gospel fear that will lead to a joyful pursuit of holiness and reverent
fear, knows that we have been ransomed. Therefore it follows that the more we
know and understand about this ransom, the greater our gospel fear will be. And
so Peter continues: "You were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from
your forefathers..." This means that we have been purchased out of a
slavery far more destructive than the Israelite's slavery in Egypt; we have
been purchased out of an inherited slavery to sin. This is a greater sight of
glory than Moses ever glimpsed on Mount Sinai when the paradox was first
revealed; in the gospel we have been ushered through a greater Exodus out of
greater slavery into greater freedom and greater glory.

PRECIOUS
BLOOD

What was
the cost of this purchase? Peter continues: "You were ransomed from the
futile ways inherited from your forefathers, not with perishable things such as
silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without
blemish or spot." No mere gold or silver or any other perishable thing
could pay for the great cost of our sin; for a rescue on this scale, a passover
lamb will not suffice. Nothing we could offer to God could come close to the
price necessary. Psalm 49 lays out this problem and solution in a beautiful,
gospel-foretelling way:

__

_Truly no man can
ransom another, or give to God the price of his life, for the ransom of their
life is costly and can never suffice, that he should live forever and never see
the pit... But God will ransom my soul from the power of Sheol, for he will
receive me. ~Psalm 49:7-9,15_

It is
impossible to ransom yourself, or to ransom anyone else, because "the
ransom of their life is costly and can never suffice." The nature of sin--
infinite crime against an infinite God-- means that no human ransom could ever
suffice. The price is impossibly high. The value of your life is simply not
enough to pay the ransom. And also note who demands the ransom: not the devil,
nor any person, but God himself. "Truly no man can give

_to God_

the price of his life."
Here we see the paradox again: God, who is the One we have offended and sinned
against, demands payment for sin and will by no means leave the guilty
unpunished. The ransom must be paid.

But God
(oh how precious are those gospel words!), but God will ransom my soul, the
psalmist declares. Only God can pay to God what God requires, and so the
impossibly high price is paid by God himself. The psalmist doesn't elaborate on
how this could be done, but standing on the other side of the cross, we know
the full reality that Psalm 49 points to: only the precious blood of Christ,
the God-man, could pay the impossibly high price of the ransom.

It would
do us well to linger longer here, on the words "the precious blood of
Christ," and let the full weight of these words sink further into our
souls, so that they will have the effect that Peter intended: a holy gospel
fear.

To feel
the full weight of these words, consider why the price had to be paid. Sin is
an infinite crime against an infinite God that deserves an infinite punishment.
One moment of less-than-perfect love, misplaced trust, or ugly pride is enough
to justly condemn you to an eternity of punishment in hell. And you and I stand
guilty of literally millions of those moments. Jesus said that the most basic
summary of God's law was "love the Lord your God with all your heart and
with all your soul and with all your mind" (Matthew 22:37). I don't think
I have ever done that, even once; I have never once loved God with every
emotion in my heart and every fiber of my being and every thought in my head.
Never once. And neither have you. That means that each and every moment of your
entire life fails to live up to even the most basic summary of God's requirement.
Every moment of my life, by itself, merits an eternity of punishment. How many
eternities of punishment have you and I earned by our costly disobedience?
Countless millions. Truly, no one can give to God the cost of his life, for the
ransom is costly and can never suffice. If left to pay it ourselves, endless
ages of eternal punishment will never exhaust our guilt.

Stand in
wonder, then, that the Son of God, in one act of sacrificing himself in your
place, paid the entirety of your debt... and the debt of every person who would
ever trust him!

Six hours on the cross
exhausted the infinite debt of countless millions, each of whom owed countless
millions of eternities of punishment. And all of that guilt was paid for by one
man, on one day, in one final sacrifice.

How
valuable, then, must the Son of God be, to be sufficient to pay the full ransom
for all God's people by himself! "The precious blood of Christ"
hardly begins to describe the great worth of Jesus Christ. He is infinitely
glorious, infinitely worthy of everlasting praise. He is the most valuable
Reality in the universe, the very definition of beauty and splendor, the King
of all creation, the Self-Existent I AM, the One by whom and for whom
everything exists. So, when he steps forward to offer the price of his life,
the sheer value of his divine person means that his sacrifice pays for all the
sins of all who trust him across all of history, and purchases them for himself
for all eternity.

Oh, how
the great worth of Jesus should move us to worship and fear! We were made to
behold his beauty, to be satisfied by his steadfast love, to delight in his
glory, to revel in his worth. And nowhere is his beauty, steadfast love, glory,
and worth more clearly displayed for the everlasting enjoyment of his people
than at the cross, where he made us his forever.

In the light of his great glory and worth,
the call to holiness and fear is simply a call to embrace what is most
beautiful, most satisfying, most thrilling-- Jesus himself.

That's
why Proverbs can say strange things like, "The fear of Yahweh is a fountain of
life." Here is the endless fountain of amazing grace, the living water flowing
from our Savior's wounds that satisfies the soul and transforms our lives. The
heart of gospel fear is seeing and feeling the infinite worth of Jesus as he
bleeds for our sins. Gospel fear trembles to think that each act of
disobedience cost the Son of God his life, trembles to realize that such a high
price would be paid for an unworthy one such as I, and trembles with joy to see
every crime against heaven absolved and paid for and buried in an ocean of
precious, atoning blood. Is it any wonder that for centuries saints have sung
with John Newton,

__

_'Twas grace that
taught my heart to fear_

__

_And grace my fears
relieved_

__

_How precious did
that grace appear_

__

_The hour I first
believed!_

May the
Holy Spirit so open your eyes to the preciousness of paradoxical grace that its
value in your eyes would only increase, day by day and into eternity, where we
will join around the throne to praise, singing, "Worthy is the Lamb who was
slain!"
