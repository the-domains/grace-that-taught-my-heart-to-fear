in the day of trouble; he knows those who take refuge in him. But with an
overflowing flood he will make a complete end of the adversaries. ~Nahum 1:7-8</i></b></p><p>Full
disclosure: I’m a weather nerd. As a teacher in Maryland—a state just far
enough north to get snow, but just far enough south that it never knows what to
do with it—snow days are one of the great delights of my life. From November to
March, I’m a full-blown amateur meteorologist. I don’t just listen to the news
to get the forecast; I follow weather blogs and pore over the raw satellite and
model data, all in the never-ending quest for a snow day. So yeah, I’m a major
weather nerd.</p><p>My
passion for meteorology started when I was a kid. I was especially fascinated
with hurricanes. My dad and I always talked about spending a summer “hurricane
hunting;” i.e., being those crazy people driving </p><p><i>towards</i></p><p> a storm when everyone else was evacuating. We never got
around to it, although to this day we still talk about driving south when a
hurricane is in the news.</p><p>Just to
be clear; I do have a healthy respect for hurricanes and am not completely
nuts. I lived on the beach of a small South Pacific island through two
hurricanes, and experienced Superstorm Sandy in 2012 as it wreaked havoc in the
Mid-Atlantic. I remember Hurricane Andrew’s devastation unleashed on South
Florida, and I watched the news along with everybody else as Hurricane Katrina
flooded New Orleans, claiming over a thousand lives. I know better than to be
reckless with a hurricane. They are not storms to be messed with.</p><p>And yet I
still love hurricanes. They are awe-inspiring, formidable, ferocious monsters,
the biggest and most powerful storms on the planet. There is something
exhilarating about standing on the beach leaning into the strongest wind you’ve
ever felt in your life, feeling the warm rain stinging your face, watching
bands of black clouds whip through the sky.</p><p>I think
hurricanes are a great metaphor for what God is like, and especially for what
it means to fear the God of grace. Hurricanes are dangerous and beautiful,
life-taking and life-giving, immense and furious—and yet deep inside the
spinning wind and waves lies a calm, safe center. The only way to truly be safe
in a hurricane is to stay in the very heart of the storm, the eye of the
hurricane. That center, the eye of the hurricane, is a perfect picture for what
it’s like to live in relationship with the God of the universe. </p><p>Look at
how Psalm 29 paints a picture of this hurricane-like God:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>The voice of Yahweh
is over the waters; the God of glory thunders. The voice of Yahweh is powerful;
the voice of Yahweh is full of majesty… The voice of Yahweh flashes forth flames
of fire. The voice of Yahweh shakes the wilderness… The voice of Yahweh makes
the oaks to shake and strips the forests bare, and in his temple all cry,
“Glory!”</i></p><p>God is
like a hurricane, a ferocious storm of holiness and justice. He is the
Self-Existent I Am of Exodus 34, who flashes forth in glory and who will by no
means clear the guilty tramplers of that glory. He is, as Deuteronomy 4:24
states, and Hebrews 12:29 reaffirms, “a consuming fire, a jealous God.” The
prophet Nahum paints a picture of the wrath of God breaking on this world like
a hurricane of fire:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>The mountains quake
before him; the hills melt; the earth heaves before him, the world and all who
dwell in it. Who can stand before his indignation? Who can endure the heat of
his anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken into
pieces by him. Yahweh is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; he knows
those who take refuge in him. But with an overflowing flood he will make a
complete end of the adversaries. ~Nahum 1:5-8</i></p><p>In that
vivid picture of our hurricane God, did you notice the strange insertion of
mercy and safety into the raging storm of justice and wrath? “Who can endure
the heat of his anger? His wrath is poured out like fire!” Nahum declares. And
yet, right in the middle of the hurricane, there is the eye of the storm, a
place of safety: “Yahweh is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; he knows
those who take refuge in him.” </p><p>Here’s the
paradox yet again: the God of wrath who will by no means leave the guilty
unpunished is the God of unfailing, steadfast love and mercy, and the only way
to escape the wrath of God is to take shelter in the mercy of God. His mercy is
a stronghold of safety from his wrath. The only ones who can endure the heat of
his anger are those who flee to the eye of the storm and take refuge in him. God
is the only one who can save you from God.</p><p>We’ve
seen the solution to this paradox in the person of Jesus Christ. He is a
sanctuary to those who trust him and a stone of stumbling to those who don’t.
He is the Lion of Judah and the Lamb of God, the One who absorbed wrath and
forgives sin. His cross is the eye of the storm, the center of the wrath of God
and the highest expression of the mercy of God. The place where the judgment of
God broke into history and was poured out completely is the only place to find safety
from that same judgment. In the violence of the cross we find safety; by his
wounds we are healed.</p><p>The Christian
life, then, is a life lived in the heart of the storm, in the place of safety
from which we can stand in awe of God’s holiness and judgment and yet be safe
from their destructive effects. Standing in the calm eye of his mercy, we see
the wave of wrath break on Christ instead of us—a front row seat to the dangerous
spectacle of God. It’s like watching an exciting, dangerous movie in the comfortable
safety of a theater, or experiencing the thrill of falling while strapped
safely into the roller coaster harness, or a little child taking the terrifying
leap off the diving board into the waiting arms of their father; as ransomed
Christ-followers we get to enjoy the danger of God while completely safe in the
faithful love of God.</p><p>Are you
enjoying the view? Or have you grown comfortable with our dangerous God? The
Christian life, lived in the eye of the storm at the foot of the cross, is
meant to be a continual drinking in of divine spectacle. Every day of the
Christian life is designed to be a day of seeing afresh with new eyes—every time
we open the Bible, every time we hear preaching, every time we worship, every
time we fellowship with believers—how our sin has been obliterated by the
hammer of God’s wrath and how the tender mercy of God has shone on us with
undeserved kindness. </p><p>At the
end of the day, this is what it means to fear God as a Christ-follower: to come
to the cross for shelter from wrath and then stay there for all our days,
marveling at the merciful and mighty God who has made us his forever. It means
striving to be holy as he is holy and living in obedience at the foot of the
cross in holy fear, knowing that we were ransomed undeservedly and at great
cost. And it means a life lived on mission, inviting and pleading for others to
come in from the storm before they are swept away forever. </p><p>May all
our days at the foot of the cross be lived to prove the truth of promises like
this:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Oh, how abundant is
your goodness, which you have stored up for those who fear you and worked for
those who take refuge in you! ~Psalm 31:19</i></p><picture>
