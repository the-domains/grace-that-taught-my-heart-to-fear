who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both
soul and body in hell. ~Matthew 10:28</i></b></p><p>There’s a
funny story from the life of Jesus in Mark 4. One day, Jesus and his disciples
cross over the Sea of Galilee in a small fishing boat, and during the
three-hour tour (cue the Gilligan’s Island theme), Jesus falls asleep in the
back of the boat. I guess it had been a long day, and the Creator and Sustainer
of the universe needed a nap (actually, spend a moment pondering in wonder at
the frail humanity of the Savior). A violent storm whips up out of nowhere—a
common occurrence on this particularly large lake, and soon the boat is in
danger of sinking. Here’s what the text says:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>A great windstorm
arose, and the waves were breaking into the boat, so that the boat was already
filling. But Jesus was in the stern, asleep on the cushion. And they woke him
and said to him, “Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?”</i></p><p>Jesus
went on snoozing right through the storm, even as the boat was actively filling
with water. (Didn’t he notice he was getting increasingly wet? I guess he
really, really needed that nap). The disciples—trained fishermen who had spent
their entire life on this lake, by the way—were panicking, and in desperation
they woke him up and accused him of not caring about their lives. </p><p>Don’t we
do that so often? In the midst of crisis, when the storm seems big and the
Savior seems small, have you ever said, “Don’t you care about me, God?” That
small voice whispers that if God really loved you, he wouldn’t put you through
that trial. If you’ve ever been tempted to doubt his goodness in the midst of
life’s storm, you’re in familiar company; get in the boat with the rest of the
doubting disciples.</p><p>In
response to their faithless accusations (and rude interruption of his nap), I
love Jesus’ response:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>And he awoke and
rebuked the wind and said to the sea, “Peace! Be still!” And the wind ceased,
and there was a great calm. He said to them, “Why are you so afraid? Have you
still no faith?”</i></p><p>With the
serenity of absolute sovereignty, Jesus stands up in the tossing boat, probably
yawns and stretches, and then calmly tell the storm to knock it off. No
theatrics, no sleight of hand or flourishing gesture, no great loud voice of
command. He simply says, “Stop,” and the storm stops. </p><p>This is
breathtaking divine power on full display. Jesus displays absolute authority
over the elements. Even the weather obeys his casual command. The One who spoke
every molecule of air and water into existence still owns their obedience, and
they still listen to his voice. Weather bows to his will.</p><p>The
disciples, however, are another story. If you had been in the boat with Jesus,
what do you think your response would have been? Glad thankfulness that your
life had been spared? Rejoicing and whooping and hugging each other? Sober
reflection that you had come so close to death? Those would all make sense. But
what about sheer terror?</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>And they were filled
with great fear and said to one another, “Who then is this, that even the wind
and sea obey him?”</i></p><p>In
response to Jesus’ calming the storm, the disciples were not happy, or
relieved, or thankful. They were scared spitless. They were “filled with great
fear,” Mark tells us. The NIV translates it as, “They were terrified.” They had
been afraid during the storm, but now that the sun is suddenly shining, they’re
terrified. Why?</p><p>It’s
because these Jewish fishermen know their Old Testaments. They know verses like
Psalm 89:8-9:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>O Yahweh God of
hosts, who is mighty as you are, O Yahweh, with your faithfulness all around
you? You rule the raging of the sea; when its waves rise, you still them.</i></p><p>They know
the Scriptures that talk of the Great I Am calming the waves of the sea. They
know prophecies that speak of God’s sovereignty over wind and rain. They know
that weather only obeys the word of one Person. And so as the sun ripped
through the disappearing storm clouds and the wild wind turned to a gentle
breeze, they turned with trembling to the One who stood calmly in the back of
the boat and realized that this was no ordinary man. “Who then is this, that even
the wind and sea obey him?” they whispered fearfully. They had been afraid in
the storm, but now they were terrified, because something more frightening than
the storm was in the boat with them.</p><p>GETTING
YOUR FEAR PRIORITIES RIGHT</p><p>The
disciples learned a valuable lesson that day: fear the right things. In a world
full of dangers, toils, and snares, the question is not “Will I be afraid?” but
rather, “Will I fear the right things?” We all intuitively understand this to
some level: a tiny little spider on a web outside is less frightening than a
giant, hairy arachnid crawling across your bed. One you might simply avoid; the
other makes you scream like a little girl and run out of the room. Riding a
roller coaster is less frightening than skydiving out of a plane. Although both
of those things might make you scream like a little girl.</p><p>You and I
make decisions every day based on calculating risks like these. We hurtle
around all day in speeding steel death traps, but try to mitigate the danger by
installing air bags and wearing seat belts. We cook our food on open flames inside
our flammable houses, but install smoke detectors and fire alarms and buy fire
insurance. Every day is full of risks and things to be afraid of, but many of
them we calculate away or take steps to avoid or accept as the cost of normal
life.</p><p>And then
there are irrational fears, like the fear of going outside—agoraphobia. Yes, I
suppose you could be hit by a meteor when you step outside, or run over when
you cross the street, but you and I all know that dealing with those risks by
fearfully refusing to leave your house isn’t healthy. Phobias are what happen
when a fear—perhaps justified, often unjustified—grows outside the bounds of
rationality and starts to control your behavior beyond what reason would
dictate.</p><p>But what
about some other fears that seem rational or normal, but which God warns
against? Like anxiety about money? That’s one I’m currently struggling with:
how am I going to pay all the bills this month? I’ve crunched the budget and
the numbers don’t add up. It took me over an hour to fall asleep the other
night because I kept running over budget scenarios in my head, filling up my
heart with anxiety about the future. We’d all probably agree that it’s not a good
thing to stress about money—and God clearly tells us not to do it—and yet most
of us do it anyway.</p><p>Or what
about what the Bible calls “the fear of man,” the desire to look good in front
of others and please people because you worry about what they think of you. Calculating
what you say based on what you anticipate their response would be, being
consumed with being popular and liked and admired, etc. Everybody does that,
right?</p><p>Or what
about our story of Jesus and his disciples in the storm? After he rebuked the
storm, he rebuked his disciples: “Why are you so afraid? Have you still no
faith?” I’ve wondered a lot about that stinging question. I think I would have
answered, “Um, Jesus, I was afraid because the boat was sinking. The danger was
real: </p><p><i>I was going to die.</i></p><p>” </p><p>Jesus,
however, seemed to think about it differently. He criticizes their lack of
faith, as if to say, “If I’m in the boat, you don’t need to worry about the
storm. The fact that you were still worried about the storm means you don’t
think I’m big enough to handle it.”</p><p>You see,
many of the fears and worries that we explain away as normal fall under the
same criticism that the disciples faced: “Why are you so afraid? Have you still
no faith?” Our problem is not that those things aren’t big deals; the problem
is that we fail to see that God is a much, much bigger deal. The problem with
worrying about money is not that I don’t have budget problems; the issue is
that I am ignoring God’s clear promises, things like, “My God will supply all
of your needs according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus” (Philippians
4:19) or “Keep your life free from the love of money, for I will never leave
you nor forsake you” (Hebrews 13:5). When I worry about what people think of me
and base my behavior on their approval, it’s because I consider their approval
to be a bigger deal than God’s approval. Fear of man is what happens when
people are big in my heart, and God is small. We forget the clear-cut command
implicit in Galatians 1:10: “Am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God?
Or am I trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not
be a servant of Christ.”</p><p>So how do
we combat these misplaced, faithless fears? The incredible answer that the
Bible gives is not simply, “Don’t fear.” Rather, the Bible’s answer is, “Fear
the right things.” It will turn out, when we start to dig into the Bible’s
words, that the solution to anxiety and fear of man and every other faithless
fear is to get our fear priorities right, and start fearing God more.</p><p>DON’T
FEAR WHAT THEY FEAR</p><p>In Isaiah
chapter 8, which we looked at in the previous chapter, this command to “fear
the right things” is laid out explicitly. At this point in history, God’s
people were frightened at the prospect of a rumored Assyrian invasion. All the
talk in the town was whether or not the Assyrians would attack, and what the
king was going to do about it. Rumors and conspiracies and fear filled the air.
And this fear was justifiable: the Assyrians were a mighty, bloodthirsty,
ruthless empire, and little Judah was a weak provincial kingdom. So we might
understand if God was sympathetic to their fears. But he wasn’t. God warned
Isaiah not to take part in their faithless rumor-mongering:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Yahweh spoke to me
with his strong hand upon me, and warned me not to walk in the way of this
people, saying, “Do not call conspiracy all that this people calls conspiracy,
and do not fear what they fear, nor be in dread. But Yahweh Almighty, him you
shall honor as holy. Let him be your fear, and let him be your dread. And he
will become a sanctuary and a stone of offense and a rock of stumbling to both
houses of Israel, a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And many
shall stumble on it. They shall fall and be broken; they shall be snared and
taken. ~Isaiah 8:11-15</i></p><p>“Don’t be
like this people,” God told Isaiah. “They’re consumed with conspiracy theories
and terror. But I’ll tell you what should terrorize you: Me.” Are you surprised
that God would talk like that? Look again at the text: “Do not fear what they
fear, nor be in dread. But Yahweh Almighty, him you shall honor as holy. </p><p><i>Let him be your fear, and let him be your
dread.</i></p><p>” “Don’t be in dread of the Assyrians; be in dread of me.” That’s a
sobering thing for the God of the universe to say. Verses like this are in the
Bible in order to blow up our nice, little, safe views of God. You can’t walk
very long through the biblical landscape without stepping on a landmine like
this.</p><p>A good
question to ask of this text would be, “Why is God more frightening than the
Assyrians?” That’s exactly the question that God answers. “Let him be your
dread. And he will become a sanctuary and a stone of offense and a rock of stumbling
to both houses of Israel, a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
And many shall stumble on it. They shall fall and be broken; they shall be
snared and taken.”</p><p>In the
previous chapter, I said that the ultimate fulfillment of this prophecy is
found in Jesus, who was the promised Rock of Stumbling and the Cornerstone
whose coming caused many in Israel to stumble and fall into destruction. That’s
true, but the prophecy also has an immediate warning for the people of Isaiah’s
day. God is saying to them, “Don’t fear what the Assyrians can do; fear my
judgment, and be in dread of falling into destruction when I judge you.” God is
warning Isaiah to have the right fear priorities, to fear most what is most
frightening. And for the God of the universe to pronounce judgment on you is
truly the most frightening thing in the universe.</p><p>THE FEAR
OF MAN AND THE FEAR OF GOD</p><p>Jesus—the
promised Sanctuary and Stone of Offense—picks up on this prophetic pattern in
his own words to his disciples and to us. In Matthew 10, Jesus gives some very
strange comfort to his fearful disciples. Jesus had just given them—and us—a glorious,
dangerous mission: </p><p><i></i></p><p><i>“Proclaim as you go,
saying, ‘The kingdom of heaven is at hand.’ “Heal the sick, raise the dead,
cleanse lepers, cast out demons. You received without paying; give without pay…
Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves.”</i></p><p>Jesus
commissioned his apostles on a mission of mercy—mercy received and mercy given.
“You received mercy freely,” Jesus reminded them. They were the recipients of
amazing, undeserved grace. “Now go and give it to others just as freely.” And
the same Savior has given us the same mission: to be conduits of free grace,
healing, and restoration, heralding the arriving kingdom to a world that needs
redemption.</p><p>But Jesus
also promised that this message of mercy would not be received well by the
world: “I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves,” he said. “They
will deliver you over to courts and flog you in their synagogues… and you will
be hated by all for my name’s sake.” The cost of following Jesus in his mission
to make mercy known to the ends of the earth will be great. It will cost every
Christ-follower some of their security, their comfort, and their dreams. It
will cost others their reputation, or their friends, or their jobs. And it will
cost some their lives.</p><p>Needless
to say, the cost of following Jesus is a frightening thing. In your comfortable
American lifestyle, this may seem to be a distant concept to you, but for many
of your brothers and sisters around the world, that fear is a daily reality. And
yet the cost of discipleship is real, regardless of your context: “If anyone
would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me”
(Matthew 16:24). Genuine discipleship always comes with a cost.</p><p>In the
face of the high cost of discipleship and mission, Jesus has a strange word of
comfort. In verses 26-33, Jesus gives a three-fold argument for fighting fear. It’s
the same logic God used with Isaiah. What Jesus says boils down to this: “Fearing
God disarms every lesser fear.” His logic can be unpacked into three smaller
arguments: the coming great reversal, the reality of hell, and the Father’s
absolute sovereignty. We’ll take those arguments one by one so that Jesus’
logic can begin to form a foundation of fearlessness in your life. And while
the immediate context of his words is mission, his logic applies more broadly, working
to free you from every anxiety and fear in your life.</p><p>THE COMING
GREAT REVERSAL</p><p>After all
his sober warnings of persecution, Jesus comforts his disciples by pointing
them to a coming great reversal:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>“So have no fear of
them, for nothing is covered that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not
be known. What I tell you in the dark, say in the light, and what you hear
whispered, proclaim on the housetops.” ~Matthew 10:26-27</i></p><p>Don’t be
afraid, Jesus says, because a great reversal is coming; everything covered will
be revealed and everything hidden will be made known. Even though it seems like
darkness is winning, dawn is almost here, and the light of justice will soon
expose every evil. Every cover-up will be brought out into the light, and every
secret sin will be known and seen. Every wrong will be made right, everything
sad will come untrue, everything broken will be fixed, every injustice will be
punished, every sin judged. And no earthly power will survive that cataclysmic
day.</p><p>The
apostle Peter speaks of this coming great reversal when he writes,</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>The day of the Lord
will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a roar, and
the heavenly bodies will be burned up and dissolved, and the earth and the
works that are done on it will be exposed. ~2 Peter 3:10</i></p><p>The great
day of the Lord, the great reversal, will explode on this world with the omnipotent
power of God’s wrath. “The heavens will pass away with a roar” and the sky will
be rolled up like a scroll. But when the judgment reaches beyond the natural
world to people, the results will be far more devastating: “the earth and the
works that are done on it will be exposed.” Every deed written in God’s books
of judgment will be revealed, and every person will be called to account. This
is not a judgment that you could possibly hide from: “No creature is hidden
from his sight, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we
must give account” (Hebrews 3:13). </p><p>In
Revelation 6, we are given a clear picture of this great reversal when every
deed is exposed and every earthly power crumbles, a judgment that no one can
hide from:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>The sky vanished
like a scroll that is being rolled up, and every mountain and island was
removed from its place. Then the kings of the earth and the great ones and the
generals and the rich and the powerful, and everyone, slave and free, hid
themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains, calling to the
mountains and rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who is seated
on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb, for the great day of their wrath
has come, and who can stand?” ~Revelation 6:14-17</i></p><p>“The
great day of their wrath has come, and who can stand?” all the inhabitants of
the earth wail. And note the universal scope of this reversal: every earthly
power—“the kings of the earth and the great ones and the generals and the rich
and the powerful”—cower before the wrath of the Lamb, but this reversal is not
limited to them. “And </p><p><i>everyone</i></p><p>, slave
and free, hid themselves.” This day that Jesus speaks of, when every hidden
thing is brought into the open and every darkness is exposed, will shatter
every soul, and there will be no escape.</p><p>Now stop
and consider for a moment this extraordinary thought: the horrible reality of
looming judgment is what Jesus is using to </p><p><i>comfort</i></p><p>
his disciples! “Have no fear of them, because nothing is covered that will not
be revealed,” he says. In other words, “Don’t be afraid, because my omnipotent
wrath and omniscient judgment will soon overtake all my enemies.” </p><p>The only
way that this can be a comforting thought is if we are no longer his enemies.
And because of the cross, that’s exactly what has happened to us. “Greater love
has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends… I have
called you friends” (John 15:13,15). We who deserve to be included in that
terrible judgment have been rescued from wrath by the One who bore all our sins
on the cross and endured the punishment we deserve. The Lamb who is coming soon
to bring wrath first came to take away wrath for all who trust him. Knowing not
only that a great reversal is coming, but that we will survive that flood and
emerge unscathed, provides great confidence against anxiety and fear.</p><p>THE
REALITY OF HELL</p><p>Jesus
continues his argument by building on what he said about the coming great
reversal. Now he turns our attention to an even more surprising argument: the
reality of hell as an antidote for fear.</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>And do not fear
those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can
destroy both soul and body in hell. ~Matthew 10:28</i></p><p>I love
this verse. Only Jesus could use hell as an argument against anxiety; he’s cool
like that. “Don’t be afraid of people,” Jesus says. “The worst they can do is
kill you!” If that sounds like strange comfort, it’s probably because we think
of death as the worst possible thing. But Jesus’ argument here pushes an
eternal perspective on us—a perspective that, if we truly embrace it, will
liberate us from a multitude of fears.</p><p>A 17</p><p><sup>th</sup></p><p>
century preacher, William Gurnall, commented on this verse: “We fear men so
much, because we fear God so little. One fear cures another. When man’s terror
scares you, turn your thoughts to the wrath of God.” Jesus is calling us here
to right-size our views of God, of eternity, and of people, because we’ve got
it all backwards. God seems to us to be relatively insignificant and harmless.
This life seems very long and most real and most important. And people—their
approval or disapproval—seem like a really big deal.</p><p>But Jesus
is graciously and firmly saying to us, “You’ve got it backwards.” God is
massively significant, infinitely valuable, and ferociously holy and glorious.
This present life is a vapor, a mist, a breath—and eternity is either endless
joy or endless torment. And people’s approval and disapproval is
microscopically insignificant in light of these weighty realities. Isaiah 2:22
says it this way:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Stop regarding man
in whose nostrils is breath, for of what account is he?</i></p><p>The
people whose approval you crave and disapproval you fear have exactly one
breath with which to affirm or discourage you. The breath that is currently in
their lungs is the only one that God has given them, the only one that they’re
promised (and for that matter, the breath currently in </p><p><i>your</i></p><p> lungs is the only one you’ve been promised too). If, in his
wisdom and good purposes, God decides to give them another breath, and another…
well, he knows what he is doing and he promises to take care of you in the
process. What’s the worst they can do to you? Kill you? Okay, so they kill you.
If you’re in Christ, that means they lose and you win.</p><p>The truth
is, death is not the worst possible thing. In fact, for the Christian, death is
gain (Philippians 1:21). Compared to the length and breadth of eternity, this
life is a fleeting vapor, a mere breath. For the believer, this present life is
but a few days of hardship and sacrifice, and then we enter into the
everlasting joy of our master and take possession of our inheritance. But
conversely, for the unbeliever, this present life is but a few days of
transient pleasures and shallow joys before the darkness of everlasting
judgment descends. If you’re a believer, the worst moment in this life is the
closest you will ever get to hell. But if you’re an unbeliever and persist in
your unbelief, the best moment in this life is the closest you will ever get to
heaven.</p><p>David
captures the wisdom of this eternal perspective when he prays in Psalm 39:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>O Yahweh, make me
know my end and what is the measure of my days; let me know how fleeting I am!
Behold, you have made my days a few handbreadths, and my lifetime is as nothing
before you. Surely all mankind stands as a mere breath! Surely mankind goes
about as a shadow! ~Psalm 39:4-6</i></p><p>Does that
sound like a bummer of a prayer to you? “Let me know how fleeting I am!” You
might be tempted to think that that’s a recipe for a morose, gloomy life, but
Jesus seems to disagree. The eternal perspective of Matthew 10:29 is not a
recipe for gloom but for joy, not for depression but for fearlessness. This is
the path to freedom.</p><p>But the
way that Jesus leads us into that fearless joy is surprising. He doesn’t do it
by directing our attention to heaven. He does it with a sober warning about
hell. “Fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.” </p><p>Matthew
25:46 says that hell is “eternal punishment.” 2 Thessalonians elaborates on
this punishment: “They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, away
from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might.” This everlasting
destruction, however, doesn’t mean that unbelievers are snuffed out and cease
to exist; that would be welcome relief compared to what Revelation 14:11 says:
“The smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever, and they have no rest,
day or night.” Mark 9:37 says that hell is “unquenchable fire.” In Matthew
13:50, Jesus described hell as “the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping
and gnashing of teeth.” Hell is unending torment, and everlasting grief, cut
off forever from all that is good or beautiful. There is nothing worse, nothing
more terrifying, than this horror.</p><p>Jesus’
recipe for fearlessness starts with reorienting your fears around that which is
truly frightening. In the light of eternity, the worst that people can do to
you is insignificant. What else is there to be afraid of, really?</p><p>THE
FATHER’S ABSOLUTE SOVEREIGNTY</p><p>The third
part of Jesus’ argument for fearlessness lays a solid foundation of confidence
underneath the coming great reversal and the reality of hell: if the God who
executes this kind of judgment loves you and is on your side, nothing should
make you afraid. Jesus’ third argument goes like this: what God values most
highly is most secure.</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Are not two sparrows
sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your
Father. But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not, therefore;
you are of more value than many sparrows. ~Matthew 10:29-31</i></p><p>Jesus
draws our attention to the insignificant details of this world: sparrows and
hair. Your hair falls out and grows in all the time without you even noticing.
Two sparrows, he says, are sold at market for a penny. And yet every one of
those sparrows—which are so small and common as to be practically worthless—are
each known by God and under his constant sovereign supervision. And every
strand of hair on your head is known and numbered by God himself. </p><p>Note
carefully what Jesus is saying, because this will make all the difference in
the world if we get it right. Jesus doesn’t</p><p>merely say that no sparrow falls to the ground without God’s knowledge.
This is not a statement about how God knows the details of every bird’s life,
proving the vastness of God’s omniscience. Of course, it’s true that God is
aware of every detail in the universe; that’s just not what Jesus is saying
here. He’s not saying that God is </p><p><i>aware </i></p><p>of
every detail in the universe; he’s saying that God is in direct, intimate,
sovereign </p><p><i>control </i></p><p>of every detail in
the universe.</p><p>Not one
insignificant sparrow anywhere on the planet ever falls off of any limb “apart
from your Father.” He is intimately involved in the life and times and death of
every creature in the universe. Just like every detail of every day of your
life was written in his book before one of them ever came to pass (Psalm
139:16), so also with the sparrows: every detail of every day of every bird
that has ever lived is orchestrated by the sovereign hand of God himself. Deep
in the extended reaches of the Amazon rainforest, where no human being has ever
set foot and where hundreds of species have lived and died undiscovered for
millennia, God is in sovereign control. No egg ever hatches and no bird ever
dies “apart from your Father.” He is intimately involved in every detail, every
moment, every life, and every death. Nothing is too small, too insignificant,
to escape the master plan of his omnipotent control. Even what appears to us as
random chaos is orchestrated by his sovereignty; even the dice obey him: “The
lot is cast in the lap, but its every decision is from Yahweh” (Proverbs
16:33).</p><p>When the
Bible speaks of God being sovereign, this is what it means: he holds every
molecule together.</p><p>Every atom moves
because he tells it to.</p><p>He holds all
power, all authority.</p><p>Every electron and
animal and person and planet and galaxy and angel and demon is under his
omnipotent governance.</p><p>His plan
encompasses and enfolds all events—every weather, every word, every random act,
every evil deed—all are subject to his sovereignty.</p><p>He has the authority and power to control all
things, and he does so at all times, without exception, for the glory of his
name and the good of his people.</p><p>If you
don't believe that, if that is not the joy and hope of your life, then your god
is too small, and Jesus’ foundation for fearlessness will crumble in your life.
The Father that Jesus invites us to trust is a God who sets up and removes kings:
"It is I who by my great power and my outstretched arm have made the
earth, with the men and animals that are on earth, and I give it to whomever it
seems right to me" (Jeremiah 27:5). All political systems and leaders are
subject to his ultimate governance.</p><p>No
law, no ordinance, no election ever falls outside his sovereignty: "The
king's heart is a stream of water in the hand of Yahweh; he turns it wherever
he will" (Proverbs 21:1). He is sovereign over your entire life, and every
step that you take: "Many are the plans in the mind of a man, but it is
the purpose of Yahweh that will stand" (Proverbs 19:21). "The heart
of man plans his way, but Yahweh establishes his steps" (Proverbs 16:9). </p><p>I am not
naïve as to the implications of this truth. History is a conveyor belt of
corpses. From the millions who perished in the Holocaust to the twenty children
murdered at Sandy Hook elementary school, to suicide, child abuse, loneliness, and
heartache, this world is filled with unspeakably horrific evil and suffering. The
notion that God could be sovereign over events like these is offensive. And yet
the Bible is clear: “See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god beside
me; I kill and I make alive; I wound and I heal; and there is none that can
deliver out of my hand” (Deuteronomy 32:39). “Does disaster come to a city,
unless Yahweh has done it?” (Amos 3:6) God does not shy away from offending us.
And if we will embrace the offense, we may just discover that what seemed like
an ugly doctrine is one of the sweetest, most precious truths in all the Bible.</p><p>You see,
we have not even begun to comprehend all that this means. The sovereignty of
God is unspeakably good news. Jesus says that the same God who reigns over the affairs
of kings and sparrows esteems you as greatly precious; in Christ, you are his
treasured possession and the apple of his eye. And this sovereign God is not
impersonal or immovable; Jesus explicitly tells us that he is our </p><p><i>Father</i></p><p>. What a comfort to know that the
God who orchestrates electrons and elections relates to us as a father relates
to his children. </p><p>Your
entire life, every moment of sweetness and suffering, is held by your Father
who loves you, who prizes you above all created things, who has made
indescribably wonderful promises to you, and has in himself all the power he
needs to fulfill every one of those promises.</p><p>Romans 8:28—ALL things work together for good for those who love God—is backed
up by a God who controls all things, governs all things, and is strong enough
to make every horror and heartache work for the eternal glory of those who love
Jesus. I find that amazing. This is assurance in the face of tragedy, a
foundation in the earthquake of uncertainty, and comfort in the midst of pain
knowing that you are not at the mercy of random chance—you are at the mercy of
a merciful and mighty God.</p><p>Do you
see now how Jesus’ argument works here in Matthew 10? “Don’t be afraid of those
who oppose you; if I am for you, who can possibly be against you? They will
perish in a moment when my wrath breaks on them, but you are secure in my love
forever. So you have nothing to be afraid of.” The reality of a coming great
reversal and the horror of hell—a judgment we have been rescued from—makes any
opposition we face on the costly road of discipleship bearable; we win in the
end.</p><p>“If God
is for us, who can be against us?” Romans 8:31 asks. The answer, of course, is
that a lot of things can be against you: people can oppose you, circumstances
can weigh you down, and the spiritual forces of evil can array themselves
against you. At times it may seem like the entire world is against you. But the
point of Romans 8:31 is this: no one can </p><p><i>successfully</i></p><p>
be against you if God is on your side; every opposition is a temporary setback
and every trial is turned to everlasting good for those who love God. So at the
end of the day, what is there to be afraid of?</p><p>The logic
of this argument holds for every fear you face, not just persecution. You have
been rescued from the coming cataclysm, so every other struggle or fear you
will face today pales in comparison with what you’ve been rescued from, and
every opposition pales in comparison with the One who is on your side. You
experience every trial from the most secure position imaginable: held by the
omnipotent hand that has extinguished all judgments against you. Nothing can
shake you from that hand of love. “In all these things we are more than
conquerors through him who loved us” (Romans 8:37).</p><picture>
